# Bayesian Inference Project Report

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named "Bayesian_Inference.ipynb" that focuses on Bayesian inference and related topics. The notebook explores various concepts and techniques in Bayesian statistics and probabilistic modeling.

## Contents

The Jupyter Notebook includes the following sections and content:

1. **Introduction to Bayesian Inference:**
   - An overview of what Bayesian inference is and why it's important in statistics and data analysis.

2. **Bayesian Probability:**
   - Explanation of Bayesian probability and its relationship to conditional probability.

3. **Bayesian Data Analysis:**
   - An example of Bayesian data analysis, including prior and posterior distributions.

4. **Bayesian Inference with PyMC3:**
   - A practical demonstration of Bayesian inference using the PyMC3 library in Python.

5. **Case Studies:**
   - Real-world case studies or examples of Bayesian inference applied to specific problems or datasets.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - A summary of key takeaways and insights from the notebook.

## Usage

To run the notebook locally or interact with its content, you'll need a Jupyter Notebook environment and the necessary Python libraries installed. You can use the following steps to get started:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already. You can use Anaconda or pip to install it.

3. Open a terminal, navigate to the repository directory, and run the command: `jupyter notebook`.

4. The Jupyter Notebook interface will open in your web browser. You can access and run the "Bayesian_Inference.ipynb" notebook from there.

## Dependencies

The notebook relies on several Python libraries, including but not limited to:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PyMC3

Make sure to install these libraries if they are not already installed in your environment.
